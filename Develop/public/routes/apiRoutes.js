//     ## Bonus
// You havenâ€™t learned how to handle DELETE requests, but this application has that functionality in the front end.
// As a bonus, see if you can add the DELETE route to the application using the following guideline
// * `DELETE /api/notes/:id` should receive a query parameter containing the id of a note to delete. 
// In order to delete a note, you'll need to read all notes from the `db.json` file, 
// remove the note with the given `id` property, and then rewrite the notes to the `db.json` file.
